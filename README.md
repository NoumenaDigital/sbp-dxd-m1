These are the documents provided for milestone #1 of the [Smart Billing Prototype](https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/645).

* Smart Billing Platform - Technical Architecture.pdf: description of the architecture and the technical design
* Smart Billing Platform - User Journeys.pdf: user journeys for all three use cases

Please note one small correction with regard to the version initially published on Google Docs: for UC3, the process flow arrow leading into `Sales offer (in SBP marketplace)` was changed. The previous step is now `Decide price for offering` instead of `Determine suggested market price`. This was a simple correction of a drawing mistake.
